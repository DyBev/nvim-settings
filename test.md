##### tasks

-  move the App filo code to GT prod
-  add the crisis line link to the filo intro
-  Border radius on chat bubbles and intro message should be 8px, not 16px or 12px
-  Chat bubbles should have approx 12px top/bottom padding, and 18px left/right, and .text div inside should have no margins
-  Too much margin below Filo image at top, should only be about 12px margin between it and intro message
-  Margin between text and “Okay” button in info screen should be about 18px
-  Text in info screen looks like it should be in bullet points?
-  “Leave chat” button in quit menu should use var(--theme_textDarker) for both border and internal text.
-  Leave chat and info dialogue should have standard dropshadow, and border radius should be 8px
-  “Report an issue” text should be in var(--theme_primary) rather than just “red”
-  The checkbox for “Share my chat with the Mind Ease team” is quite misaligned - I’d suggest changing the text to “Share chat with Mind Ease” and not restyling the li label at all.
